# L1-DGNSS accuracy verification - by comparison with known points
**Conclusion: the shorter the baseline length and the lower the noise, the better**.

## Location

- Large landslides seen from an airplane in the Tohoku region
  - Maximum difference in elevation between measurement points 202.4 m, maximum baseline 1.4 km
- Base: 1 point (coordinates unknown)
- Rover: 14 points (coordinates known)
- Rover specification: EMLID Reach RS
  - Instrument nominal accuracy: 5.0 mm horizontal + 1 ppm × D, 7.0 mm vertical + 1 ppm × D
  - Maximum value of D = 1,400 m, **horizontal 6.4 mm**, **vertical 8.4 mm**
  - Antenna height 2.0865 m, 60-minute bubble tube  
      - When the air bubble contacts the marker circle, the antenna position is displaced by 36.42 mm in the horizontal direction.
      - Actually it is set up for the center of the marking circle.
- Known Coordinates: GNSS 1st class surveyor single frequency static method
  - Nominal accuracy of the device: 3.0 mm horizontal + 0.5 ppm x D, 5.0 mm vertical + 0.5 ppm x D
  - Maximum D = 1,880 m, ** 3.94 mm**, ** 3.94 mm flat, ** 5.94 mm vertical**

## Method

- Rover measurement time: 3 minutes
- How to install Rover
  - Place the monopole props in the center of the recess or nail in the center of the pile head at the known point.
- RTKPOST processing
  1. Base coordinate is calculated backward from the known coordinate of the nearest neighbor.
  2. find the coordinates of the remaining 13 points with RTKPOST
- Two types of accuracy verification
  1. Comparison of the coordinates of 13 points with the coordinates of known points (Last of 999.9)
  2. a comparison of Last of 999.9 and Ave of 999.9

## Result 1: Comparison with known points
- the nearest known points from the Base (1 point)
- Use it for inverse calculation of absolute coordinates of the Base

- The remaining 13 known points.
  - Fix 11 points
  - Float 2 points
  - Known point coordinate error 1 point (excluded)

- One of the Fix points (0113-11) has a maximum ratio of 471.4  
  - The coordinate value for this point is an epoch of ratio 471.4
  - for Ave, average is calculated using epochs with a ratio of more than 100

## Discussion 1: L1-DGNSS Accuracy assessment

- **It is a simple survey method that provides the best accuracy at this time**.
  - For short baselines (1.4 km in this case), you can get a good accuracy with the Fix solution.
    - Horizontal (D2d): Ave 1.70 cm, SD 1.11
    - Three-dimensional (D3d): Ave 3.24 cm, SD 2.09
  - Three dimensional accuracy (U-D accuracy) has the potential to be better.
    - The exact height reference plane of the pile head at the base point measurement was unknown (professionals use a tripod). It was hammered with high nails, carved crosses, tilted, and in various states of disrepair.
- What does accuracy assessment verify: Error = Observation Error + Instrument Installation Error + Known Point Error**
  - As far as horizontal accuracy is concerned, the error in instrumentation by the observer is small (self-aggrandizement).
  - Although it is difficult to separate the accuracy of PPK-L1GNSS itself from other factors (instrument installation error and known point error), instrument installation error may be a major contributor to the overall error.
- **Indicators for obtaining a Fix solution: GDOP and SNR**
  - The GDOP of the Float solution point is not as bad as the Fix solution point. However, the overall SNR is low; the reason for the low SNR could be due to shading by vegetative foliage

## Discussion 2: Last vs. Ave

- **Everything is pretty much the same regardless of which one you use; Last of 999.9 would be fine**.
  - The difference between the Last and Ave coordinates
    - Horizontal (D2d): average 1.7 mm, SD 1.4
    - Three-dimensional (D3d): average 3.4 mm, SD 2.7
  - Comparison with known points
    - Horizontal mean 1.70 cm, SD 1.11, three-dimensional mean 3.24 cm, SD 2.09
    - Horizontal mean 1.76 cm, SD 1.14, three-dimensional mean 3.18 cm, SD 2.15
- Advantages and disadvantages  
When using Last of 999.9:  
　pros) The acquisition of coordinates is completed by copying and pasting one line. Easy to work with.  
　cons) Troubles when there are multiple 999.9 peaks or a large tendency for the position to change  
If you use Ave of 999.9:  
　pros) Even if the change in position is large, a value close to the overall trend can be obtained (probably).  
　cons) The work is tedious (shaping of pos, extraction of 999.9, and averaging of coordinate values)

## Reach RS / Reach RTK

- **Reach RS has the advantage of higher antenna gain**.
- Reach RS: Antenna TW2706, LNA Gain 28 db typ.
- Reach RTK: Antenna TW4721, LNA Gain 26 db min.  
　A (wildly) simple calculation shows that RS's antenna has a 1.26 times greater gain.
